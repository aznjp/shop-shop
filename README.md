## Description
 As a User I want to be able to consume products in an convenient manner and stack up my shopping cart with items. 
 When I finish filling up my cart I want to be given the ability to purchase the items through a credit card form (which in our case we utilized the Stripe-API). Once those items are bought it will conveniently show me all of my purchase items and then return me back to the original homepage thereafter.
